NOTE 1:
========
This Eclipse sample project will not compile.  Its purpose is to provide a beginning point for a software 
developer to follow the coding comments to complete the syntax such that this sample can compile and be compared
against the CustomApp_AWT_STK_Objects_Tutorial_End Eclipse sample project.  This provides the developer with hands on coding experience with
the STK Object Model.
